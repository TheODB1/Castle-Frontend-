Get Married in Dream Castles
Real-Life Castles You Can Get Married in for Your Very Own Royal Wedding

Having a castle wedding is a dream of many brides. After all, seeing all those Disney movies since we were a child affected us allâ€¦ Letâ€™s face it: castles, prince charming and happily ever after are basics. Who doesnâ€™t want that? Although it looks like a fairy tale, this is not so far away of reality. If you read the post about the reasons you should have a destination wedding in Germany, you already know that one of these Disney castles we saw in the movie was inspired in the amazing Neuschwanstein in Germany. And this is a country with more than 25.000 castles, mostly of which are available for celebrating your big day. Ok, I know, 25.000 might be too many for you. Thatâ€™s why we decided to put together our favorite castles to get married in Germany (until now).
